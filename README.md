## Overview

### Description

[AnonChat is a mobile app that allows users to post and reply to short, anonymous messages within their campus community. Students log in with their school email to verify their affiliation, but all posts and replies remain anonymous. The goal is to create a safe and fun space for authentic expression, connection, and discussion.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
- **Mobile: The app is designed primarily for mobile users. Quick posting, scrolling, and replying are ideal for a mobile interface.**
- **Story: Students often want to share thoughts or questions they might not feel comfortable attaching their name to. The app gives them a way to connect authentically.**
- **Market: Anonymous social platforms like Fizz and YikYak have proven demand on college campuses. Target users are university students.**
- **Habit: Users can develop a daily habit of checking posts, reacting to messages, and staying connected to campus life.**
- **Scope: The MVP is realistic for a student project: login, anonymous posting, viewing posts, and replying. Advanced features (moderation, upvotes, etc.) can come later.**
